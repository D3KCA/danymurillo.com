    <h1>Dany Murillo</h1>
    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p>
      Some of the things that you can find here are my hobbies, projects, and
      other things I take interest in.
    </p>
    <h4>Ice Breaker</h4>
    <p>
      I am Dany, currently I work for Home Depot, and some of the things that I
      like are Computers, Amature Radio, People, Walking, Hiking, Biking and
      Problem Solving.
    </p>
    <h4>Website</h4>
    <p>
      You may notice that this website is not like others that is due to wanting
      to try to keep it simple, and also because I only know a little bit about
      creating web pages so far I am learning as I go, and I may change things
      in the future but for now this is how I like it.
    </p>

    <h4>Thank you for stoping by!</h4>
