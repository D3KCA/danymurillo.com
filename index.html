    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p>
      Some of the things that you can find here are my hobbies, projects, and
      other things I take interest in.
    </p>
    <h4>Ice Breaker</h4>
    <p>
      I am Dany, currently I work for Home Depot, and some of the things that I
      like are Technology, Amature Radio, People, Walking, Hiking, Biking and
      Problem Solving.
    </p>
    <h4>Website</h4>
    <p>
      You may notice that this website is not like others that is due to wanting
      to try to keep it simple, and also because I only know a little bit about
      creating web pages so far I am learning as I go. This is also a collection
      of me so with that in mind all views are my own.
