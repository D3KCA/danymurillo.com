    <h1>What I Am Doing Now</h1>
    <p>Updated June 5th, 2025, From my Nook</p>
    <h4>Making a Website</h4>
    <p>
      This was inspired by wanting to create my own space on the internet, and
      an interest in computers and the ways that they work. it's taken some time
      for me to actually get a good start due to overthinking all styling that you are
      able to do.
